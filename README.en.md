# TracionadorPET ♻️

<p><b>The TracionadorPET was developed as a project for the class 'PROJETOS I' in the Mechatronics technical course at the Instituto Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (IFSul).</b></p>
<p><b>The main objective of this project is to recycle PET bottles into 3D printing filament.</b></p>
<p><b>In this repository, you will find all the CAD files from the project, as well as the electrical schematic. Additionally, you will find the Arduino code and a components list.</b></p>
